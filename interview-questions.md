# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: a parameter would be items that are named and assigned values that can later be input into functions. an argument is the data that gets applied to the function. Name = Oscar Name would be the parameter where as oscar would be the data getting passed through. the variable name could be used as required but the argument would change person to person.

Researched answer: A parameter is defined as the names listed in the defintion of the argument whereas the data would be the value directly applied to the function. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: I believe the predefined parameters taken by map built in method would be index, value, and array. the only one that is required is the value. 

Researched answer: The only required parameter by the map function is the value, There are a couple more that can be used being the array and the index however they are not required. The order of the values is what matters they shall always be applied in the following order(value, index, array)

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map and filter are different because .filter requires a conditional to be met in order to place elements into the new array. Whereas map will return an array of the same value as the array that was input in the function. 

Researched answer: Filter returns a subset of the given array, one that meets the condition provided in the custom criteria, The map built in method will always return an array of equal length to the original. It doesnt require a condition to be met. If I had an array [1,2,3,4], the map built in method could be utilized to multiply the values in array by a factor of 3 as such [3,6,9,12]. The filter method could manipulate the given array to remove all the odd numbers and return an array of [2,4].

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: I think iteration is when a process keeps running and repeating until a condition is met. 

Researched answer: Iteration is defined as the repitition of a process until a condition is met, the condition being met is the crucial part. It is used heavily in for loops but also for higher order functions. It can be used as part of the built in method .map which will allow an array to altered to the criteria provided by each individual developer. 

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: a class can be created and given placeholders as values so that it can be used to make various objects later down the line. Whereas an object will contain static values in order to represent the object for example in if i wanted to identify myself as a student in the cohort for the class i could name the object learn student given key as firstName: oscar, lastName: gomez age: 25 would be my keys whereas a class would could be created for the learn students which could be applied to all the students at learn. 

Researched answer: A class is a logical entity that can be used for the creation of multiple classes, it can be thought as the instructions for the creation of more classes whereas an object is defined by the physical keys it is given, it is not dynamic it is static and can only ever be defined by the key value pairs it was assigned. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Being able to use a variable outside of the scope it was written in. 

Researched answer: Hoisting is the process of being able to move the declarations of variables to the top of the scope to run before the variables are declared. Typically let, const and class are referred to as being non-hoisting because of the strict rules for the utilization of these variables. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: a user story is a brief explanation of an application through the eyes of an end user. It can also include physical featurs of the app itself. 

2. Spread operator: Spread operator allows you to copy an array string or object quickly into another array

3. React state: An object created inside of React that allows for changes in the object as a response to the user. 

4. React props: Props is short for properties and they are how you pass data from one component to another. They utilize HTML Syntax.

5. DOM events: React events use the camelCase method and are passed using JSX. In React you don't need to use add event listeners after it's created.
